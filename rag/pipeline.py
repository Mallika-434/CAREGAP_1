RAG Pipeline — Habit & Lifestyle Suggestions
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Architecture:
  1. A curated knowledge base of clinical lifestyle guidelines
     (diabetes, hypertension, diet, exercise) is embedded into
     a FAISS vector store using sentence-transformers.
  2. At query time, the patient's risk profile is used to form
     a retrieval query.
  3. Relevant chunks are retrieved and injected as context into
     a prompt sent to Ollama (LLaMA3 or any local model).
  4. Ollama returns personalized habit suggestions.

Setup:
  python manage.py build_rag_index   ← run once to build FAISS index
